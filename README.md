## Final Project Argentina Programa - Stage "Yo Programo" - Backend

This is a DEMO of my üíº Portfolio's backend. A complete CRUD, written from scratch in Java and Spring Boot 3.0, applying SOLID principles.
It has Spring Security 6 and Jwt configured. It can make use of two roles. It has a functionality of auto-refreshing tokens and Password Management, List Sorting, among others.

This repository, in addition to containing the code submitted for the last stage of Argentina Programa, serves as the basic example code for my current portfolio. Due to security reasons, my real portfolio is kept as a private repository.
